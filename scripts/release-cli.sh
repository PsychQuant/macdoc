#!/bin/bash
# release-cli.sh — signed + notarized release pipeline for the macdoc CLI.
#
# arm64-only: the CLI depends on MLX (Apple Silicon exclusive), so a
# universal build is neither possible nor meaningful. Intel users build
# from source (README).
#
# Usage: scripts/release-cli.sh <version>    # e.g. scripts/release-cli.sh 0.6.0
#
# Pipeline: arm64 release build → Developer ID codesign (hardened runtime +
# timestamp) → PRE-UPLOAD SIGNATURE GATE → notarize (must be Accepted) →
# arm64 arch check → sha256 → gh release (creates tag) with binary + .sha256.
#
# The gate exists because v3.20.0 of CheWordMCP shipped ad-hoc signed
# (che-word-mcp#165): the marketplace wrappers verify the SAME requirement
# on install/exec (PsychQuant/macdoc#112), so an unsigned asset means new
# installs hard-fail. Gate requirement string MUST stay in lockstep with
# the wrapper's verify_binary() (macdoc plugins/*/bin/*-wrapper.sh).
#
# SCOPE HONESTY (verify DA-1): this gate protects releases made THROUGH
# this script. A manual `gh release upload` bypasses it — the backstops
# for that path are process discipline and the wrappers' fail-closed
# install gate (which turns an unsigned asset into a loud install failure
# rather than a silent compromise).
#
# Refs PsychQuant/macdoc#119.
